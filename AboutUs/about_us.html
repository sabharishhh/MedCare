            Certain legacies transcend time, leaving an indelible mark on the

            Founded in 1960, Med Care Hospital began as a small clinic with just
            10 beds and one dedicated doctor. It was established with a vision
            by Dr. John Mathew, a pioneer in medical service, who aimed to
            create a healthcare institution that provided quality medical care
            with a human touch. What started as a modest venture has now
            blossomed into a world-class, multi-specialty hospital known for its
            excellence in patient care.
          </p>

            staffed by more than 150 expert doctors and supported by a dedicated
            team of over 1200 healthcare professionals. We pride ourselves on
